abstract = {LIBSVM is a library for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We have been actively developing
this package since the year 2000. The goal is to help users to easily apply SVM to
their applications. LIBSVM has gained wide popularity in machine learning and many
other areas. In this article, we present all implementation details of LIBSVM. Issues
such as solving SVM optimization problems theoretical convergence multiclass classification
probability estimates and parameter selection are discussed in detail.},
