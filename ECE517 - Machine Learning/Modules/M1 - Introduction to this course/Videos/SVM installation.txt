 In this video we're going to see how to install the SBM package for MATLAB, and also we'll see where the package for Python is. I'm going to see the example for MATLAB. For Python there is others, but I'm gonna use MATLAB because it's easier for you to start. So then, first thing that we have to do is to type svm lib here. And then we find a link here, click it, and you have this library for support vector machines with all the instructions here. If you scroll down, you will find the zip file that you can download. You click on it, download it and install. Basically you expand it in a folder. In my case, I have it in Documents > MATLAB > libsvm. And you will see here a set of Folders and files. You simply go to MATLAB. Go to Set Path, add which folders. Go to the corresponding folder, here, here and here. Open, Save, and Close, and that's it. Then if you type svmtrain, And you can see this, the package is working. These are the instructions, we will go through them in the next video. There is another function, svmpredict, Here, and if you can see this, this function works, too. If you cannot see this, is maybe because you have Windows in a version which is not compatible with a compilation that you can find here. So then you go with your MATLAB to this folder, okay? libsvm, MATLAB. And once you are inside, then you can type make, like that. I don't know if this is gonna work in, In Mac, but let's do it. So you simply type make, like that, and in Windows it shall work. You should see a new version of libsvmpredict and libsvmframe for your version of MATLAB and for your version of Windows. In this case it says completed successfully. If you see this and then you type again, svmtrain, the thing should be working.
