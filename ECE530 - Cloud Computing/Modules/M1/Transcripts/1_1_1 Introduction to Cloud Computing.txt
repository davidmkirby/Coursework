 >> Welcome to ECE 530 Cloud Computing. My name is [inaudible]. Today I'm going to cover the introduction to cloud computing. The objective of this module overall is for students completing this module, they will be able to explain the motivation behind cloud computing, and how it is used nowadays. The development of file systems, and the history of cyberinfrastructure. What is the cloud? This is a common question that we hear nowadays. Cloud is a very important part of a number of businesses. Effectively there is no such thing as the cloud. It just probably someone else's computer. What does this mean? It means that we're using infrastructure, we're using machines, we're using computers, but they don't belong to us. But we're able to connect to them through the network and that has been possible because of the broadband adoption of broadband networks. The other question that we have to answer is whether cloud computing is important, and what we're trying to see in this table here, is the growth of the market of cloud computing. In this picture that the source is Gartner, that was the data collected in April 2017, about a year ago. What this indicates is the growth of cloud computing. Cloud expenses in four years or in three years from now, will actually almost double to $302 billion. We're talking about a huge business. While some of the definition here is like cloud business process services, cloud application infrastructure services, cloud application services, cloud management security services, and cloud system infrastructure services are not very clear to you right now, but these are exactly the terminology we're going to cover in this course. But the important aspect here is to understand that cloud computing is growing and it's going to grow a lot in the future. What we see as a distribution is most of actually the revenue will come from software as a service, that means software that will be built on top of the cloud to serve everyday needs. I can give you a few examples even from today. Today we see companies like Netflix, they call themselves cloud-native, that means they're under all infrastructure inside cloud computing. Many other common is Facebook, is introducing a cloud. Google has been using a fairly big data center deployment and now they move towards offering that as a public cloud offering which is named as Google Cloud. Amazon is probably the largest cloud vendor right now, which is used. How did it start? It started because they had so much computing resources that they were not using all they time. That means they had available resources to provide to other users. This is another study. The study comes from IDC 2016, about two years ago. This shows the worldwide spending on public cloud computing. That means that how many users pretty much and how much you're going to spend once they start on boarding cloud computing. We see the goals going to be tremendous. From 2018-2020, we're seeing about $50 billion will be spent on that and the growth will not stop. It will continue because cloud computing has not yet reached what we call the maturity phase of the product. Another interesting data point is cloud computing, and that comes from Forbes, is projected to increase from 67 billion in 2017 to 162 billion in 2020, with a growth of about 90 percent year after year. What does this mean? Why do I present you these statistics today? I do that because this indicates that this is a hot course. This is a course at understanding the cloud computing will be very important later on once you get a job and if you work in this computer science industry, because many companies are actually using cloud computing or ROS, or otherwise, are moving towards cloud infrastructure.
