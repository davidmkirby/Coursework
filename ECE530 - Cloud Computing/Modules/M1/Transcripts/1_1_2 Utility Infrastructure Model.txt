 >> Let's discuss today about the utility infrastructure model. The traditional infrastructure model is that we have some forecasted infrastructure demand. That means at how much infrastructure we're going to use as our company grows, and therefore, based on that, we'll make some capital expenses. Let's assume that we buy today about 10 computers, all of a sudden everything works fine, but in a few months from now, our company grows a lot now we need 20 computers. Now, we buy another 20 computers. Then our company grows even bigger. Now, we actually need 100 computers and now we need to purchase another 100 computers. What we see is that we have situations where we actually buy computers or buy infrastructure, or storage, or whatever this is in advance from actually using that. What this means is that we have a significant surplus. We spend more money than what we need. This is a problem because that means that we're not really focusing or following the actual growth of the infrastructure itself. But the demand also is important. We may need 10 computers, we may need 20 computers, and 100 computers later on as the growth increases, but we don't use a computer all the time. We don't really store all the files all the time. We actually may move them in another storage medium. In many occasions, some of the traffic patterns follow what we call the [inaudible] traffic patterns. The actual infrastructure demand is totally different. What this means is that we even have a surplus. This is actually unacceptable because it costs the company extra money to maintain that. We also have a deficit. Occasionally, we may need more and we actually need a little earlier on, and because we didn't have the time to purchase this infrastructure, we are actually waiting to get this infrastructure if we don't do it properly. Which means that now we have a problem of a deficit of resources and therefore, scheduling this becomes a very complicated problem. Now, let's think about the utility infrastructure model. For example, this is what Amazon thought initially when they created cloud computing. They have this pattern where during the night we don't really use this, but during the day we actually use some infrastructure. Then what you see here is, we see this actual infrastructure demand. If we're able to book resources as we need them, then all of a sudden the surplus and deficit goes towards zero. Because you're actually following this infrastructure demand. In the scale up and scale out of resources is what cloud computing is comprised of. The ability to be able to scale resources as we need them. [NOISE]
