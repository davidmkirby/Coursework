 >> Previously we have discussed how we have moved from being able to track the growth of our infrastructure needs, of our platform needs, and capture that based on how Cloud really does that with scale up and scale down of resources. What do we mean by scale up? Scale up of resources means that we can increase the number of virtual machines or servers that we deploy according to the needs of the applications. Let me give you an example. During the night, we may have more traffic at Netflix because people watch more movies. Therefore, we need to scale up more servers that common at these growth. During the night we have less users, but we can also accommodate the spare capacity to do some video and coding of our videos, for example. Same thing happens with many other companies like Amazon. Amazon, when people go and buy products, let's say on Black Friday, they scale up all these amazing resources to be able to come on this traffic, but the next day, on Saturday or Sunday, or even next Monday after Thanksgiving, there is not much traffic or as much as Black Friday because of the deals they offer. What happens is now they have to scale down these resources because they don't really need them. The model they created is, well, something, if I don't really use them, I can offer them to somebody else to do that. That's how Amazon Cloud came up. Now, let's see the history and the momentum from mainframes to the [inaudible] of things. In the beginning, it was the mainframe and the terminals. You used to sit down and work on a big, beefy computer. You can't do really much, but you could really type and do a few commands left and right. It devote users do individual work by connecting to a central computer, you did your work, and somebody else came and did his work, and somebody else came and did his work. We used to have all these disks and cassettes, we then plug in and play and to store the data and so forth. Then [inaudible] about 1980s, were talking about the personal computer. Now, users did individual work on their own desktops. You sit down, now, you have your own, at your own system, at your own house, and you'd really plugin and diskette that, you store the data and move to another computer you put the diskette in, and then now, all of a sudden you have the data, you just moved from one location to the other. The problem back then, it was of course, that if you had a magnet, data could be lost. There were many issues back then once you start moving data left and right. Then what happened about 1980s, we're talking about the network. Then the PCs got connected, and now, you create the network of PCs that they talk to each other, you have a centralized storage system, you have a centralized printer when you print everything and so forth. Now you're creating some security because you don't want invaders from the outside to access your network and therefore you get firewalls for outside folks. Then about towards 1990s towards 2000, then there was the web revolution. Now we had all these web application and Google started becoming big. Facebook started being in all these comments that we actually know, Amazon, and so forth, became the big entries in the web. They created this web where people could actually go and retrieve information, connect to other computers and to other people, and really be able to obtain information without really needing to have a physical machine other than on laptop. About 2000, 2010 became really big. We had server had to become cluster of partial computers. Care and feeding become expensive and that's going to become very complicated in all over the world. Therefore, we had to accommodate this grow, this huge growth of the Internet. Nowadays, we're getting to the momentum of the Internet of things. Now were giving Internet to every single device around the world, but where this is like these vehicles, and assets, and persons, and pet monitoring and controlling, this is one. Now, we have agricultural automation. We put sensors sourcing in the fields and we let our tracks go around the fields and effectively be able to monitor the field remotely. Now, you know how much water you can spend in each of portions of this field because now you have data points from all of the sensors you have deployed. Now, also have energy consumption. [inaudible] came up with this intelligent bulbs where they contain scholars and they can do that from a mobile phone. You can change, for example, other things like how many lights are on. You can change them based on feedback from your TV. Having connected items in things that they interact based in changes. We also have security and surveillance. We have cameras all over the place, all of them connected to the network that they're able to monitor. Building management were now we can manage a building from a central entity like elevators, we can control them from a smart phone, or water, we can monitor that. To telemedicine in health care where we can do surgeries remotely or we can have experts from different areas really do big parts of monitor. Let's say patients remotely without really needing to be there. To smart home and cities where, for example, now, if there is high traffic in one intersection, we can really route people [inaudible] by changing the way traffic lights operate. To everyday things from shoes. Now, Nike offers the essentials that you put in your shoes so they can know how many steps you do and how many calories you have burned. Then mobile to mobile wireless sensor networks and embed mobile things. A lot of things is now becoming the fact of things that brings the Cloud computing a huge value.
