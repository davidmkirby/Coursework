 >> [NOISE] Now let's move to the datacenters and supercomputers. This is the ECE 530 cloud computing. Once the website becomes really big, and we've seen that from the Internet of things and really, really important. Now what we have is several pieces how to live in expensive datacenters. This is an example of the Microsoft Data Center in Dublin. It's about 27,000 square meters, about 22 megabytes and cost about half a billion dollars to build. As you can see, it's very expensive to Gaza for a lot of cooling and a lot of real estate to build a datacenter. Microsoft really needed that because now they have to serve customers for other applications where there's emails, or Hotmail, or accessing the web, and so forth. Now we came to mega datacenters like huge datacenters, huge facilities. A lot of people to be employed to be able to serve the need for that. [NOISE] After that, we required a lot of things like now cooling an infrastructure to build and a lot of batteries and backups to be able to maintain the infrastructure whenever it really something was going south. All this infrastructure became really important. The challenges to that is how do you become agile, green, and smart growth for that. You can really move datacenters around. It's really hard and you need a lot of expensive materials and employees to be able to build and maintain infrastructure like that and really scale up for the growth. In summary, datacenters will require a lot of electricity power like 1.5 percent of all US electricity back in 2007, later alone 10 years has RAM at where we are right now. It was a long lead time to build. It require about 3 years, or 4 years, or 5 years to really build a data in up and running. All this time you don't have an infrastructure available for you, which means that you are watching without it. It's an inflexible investment of capital. Once you put your money in your data so you can't get them out. It's not like a bank where you can invest it. It's more about you're putting your money into infrastructure once you really need it. It also requires very specialized skills for infrastructure like security, failover, and load balancing. These skills are expensive to buy them. Once you have these people that have these skills, really keeping them around, you can only keep them for a specific amount of time. At the same time, you get a small common, let's say you're now building the new snap or the new application is going to change the world like voice of our API or whatsoever. It takes out time from your core competencies. If you start being datacenters, you're really doing what's important for you. Of course, it's hard for all but largest communist to really own and run. If you're Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, you can really build datacenters because you have the capital like an Apple. But if you're in a small midsize company, really spend your money in datacenters is not really something that you really want to do because that means that you're not spending them in core competencies. Let's now think about how these momentum started. What is a supercomputer? A supercomputer is a collective of computing system that provides processing probabilities exceeding that of any system ever built. The process of built means are built quickly perform calculations. You can collect and process tremendous a lot of data and unique habits of computationally challenging problems. Supercomputers, of course, will be the first level or the first way, the father of God for behold, call it. Here's an example of the NASA Supercomputer, which is really huge like a big datacenter like now NASA really needed that to analyze a lot of system. That thing was built in 2003 and has 10,000 processors, one terabyte per second memory bandwidth, huge teraflops of performance. IBM Roadrunner was another big supercomputer in IBM for every significant amount of time, invested a lot in supercomputers, not so much anymore. It was the second fastest supercomputer that was built in 2008, 1.38 Petaflops of data, 24,000 processors. Of course, you really need like advanced scheduling system to use this supercomputers because otherwise we're having lower your resources, your electricity, cooling systems and all this infrastructure build really spent for nothing if you don't use them at all times. I would say the most modern one and the most beautiful one is the one Barcelona in Spain they called MareNostrum. MareNostrum is Mediterranean seen Lottie and effective are the most nicest ones. It's not like huge. It's about 48,896 Cores. It has about 925.1 teraflops in the linpack performance. Theoretically, it can achieve more than 1,000 teraflops. It burns about one megabyte per hour. It has InfiniBand FDR, and it's based on Linux. If you look at the networking. The networking of any datacenter or supercomputer has to be very clearly defined. You can have cables left and right because it's hard to maintain them. It's like you can see you have thousands of kilos coming out from different places. As you can see, this is a great organization of one of the MareNostrum Interconnection Network. The question always comes, what's the fastest computer out there? The fastest really entirely it's called Tianhe-2. Tianhe-2 or MilkyWay-2 is a clash of Intel Xeon E5-2692 with 2.2 gigahertz CPU but Xeon processor. It has about 3,120,000 cores, which brings about 33,867 teraflops. It's about theoretically speed of 54,902 teraflops per second. We're taking about 1,024,000 gigabytes of memory. This is a huge investment in really doing advanced processing for biological analyzing DNA or doing any processing that is important to be able to scale up for the computational needs that require none, right now based on the big data growth. As I said, super promoter is the grandfather of Cloud computing because we have so much resources out there that we don't use them all the time.
