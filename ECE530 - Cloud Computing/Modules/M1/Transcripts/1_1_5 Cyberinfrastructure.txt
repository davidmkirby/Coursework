 >> Welcome to the cloud computing and today we're going to discuss about cyberinfrastructure. One of the fundamental elements of how cyberinfrastructure and cloud computing and many other pieces started was effectively the high-performance computing. What is high-performance computing? The application of computer technology exceeding the capabilities of a desktop computer to solve problems that cannot be easily solved on a desktop computer. If you start thinking about the definition of high-performance computing, the way we just defined it, it has a lot of similarities in the way cloud computing is being used. What I mean by that? Now, we don't have enough resources in our own systems, therefore, we have to use a certain pool of resources. To be honest, high-performance computing, HPC has the scheduling of resources. It's pretty much the same as in cloud computing. Let's see now what does a really cyberinfrastructure includes. It includes; supercomputers, cluster computers, distributed computing, grid computing, and any kind of exotic hardware. For example, recently for machine learning and artificial intelligence, we've seen specialized hardware we've based on FPGAs, that is, field-programming gate arrays. [NOISE] What is grid computing? Grid computing is a high-performance computing system built as a geographically-distributed system from a collection of cluster computers, supercomputers, desktop computers, and storage systems, all collection via high-speed network. This is a definition of those two first. Now, what is overall, the term cyberinfrastructure? It's an information technology framework for discovery and collaboration. More specifically, it is anything related to instrument and sensors, high-performance computing, cloud computing, data storage systems, visualization facilities, all tied together by a high-speed network. In other words, cyberinfrastructure is pretty much anything that is outside of our own laptops. This is the infrastructure existing to help us analyzing data, store data, and so forth. [NOISE] To be honest, the data for cyberinfrastructure came out from the federal government. About 2000-2001, NSF, The National Scholarship Foundation created this terminology. If we start thinking about cyberinfrastructure, that is anything related to all the components that we use to do things like high performance services, data, information, knowledge management services, observation measurement, fabrication services, interfaces, virtualization services, collaboration services, all tied together and connected by a network, operating system and middleware. This is effectively the cyberinfrastructure and includes both the personnel as well as the hardware, the software, the services, and the organizations. The reason we tried to define cyberinfrastructure, it's because it's a term that is being used out there and sometimes, it's getting confused with cloud computing. Cloud computing is part of the cyberinfrastructure.
