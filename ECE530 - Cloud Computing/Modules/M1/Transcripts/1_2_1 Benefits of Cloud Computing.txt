 >> Let us now see the benefits of Cloud Computing. The solution to the problem we have mentioned in our earlier lectures about the data center is to outsource the data centers. The reason you want to go do that is because effectively data centers does not help with columns of scale. You have this long investment that you do in a specific infrastructure that you cannot really move it around when you want. But with Cloud Computing, we mentioned before about how we can really follow economies of scale, like as we grow, our capabilities of computers also grows. Because of scale, now we can afford specialized skills. We don't have to spend [NOISE] our specialized skill salaries into things that are hard to move. Moreover, we see more and more applications getting really big in the website like Facebook, Google, Netflix, Amazon, and so forth. Those web developers can now concentrate on their core competencies instead of giving them and give them a market advantage. Instead of focusing on, let's say, deployed data centers. At the same time, the right time to start from having an idea to having a productional system, is really, really small nowadays. In addition, you don't really need a lot of infrastructure to support the computing resources in the beginning, because now you have lower capital requirements. At the same time, computing power becomes a commodity as the electrical power in 20th century, and it's very, very important. The benefits of Cloud Computing, it can reduce capital and operational expenses. You no longer require to make a large upfront capital investments to data centers. You eliminate need to plan ahead for provisioning and you allow communists to start small increase as the move ahead and as they go, which is the pay-as-you-go model. [NOISE] You simplify application development management by common programming models across mobile, browser, client, server and cloud. Access to strong ecosystem of widely deployed applications and now you have integrated with existing ideas like software or assets. The Cloud benefits; The Cloud offers low pay-as-you-go pricing with no upfront expenses or long-term commitments. This is important because now you don't have to have any other commitments, or you don't have to have any other SLAs or SLOs. Cloud vendors build and manage global infrastructure at scale. They pass the cost saving benefits onto the clients in the form of lower prices. What we have been seeing in the last few years running private Cloud providers, is that Cloud providers let's say they data CPUs, data networking and data storage, and because they do that at massive scale, the cost on a per entity or per a company, is way, way smaller than it would be to update your own infrastructure to the latest, let's say CPU and so forth. With the features of Cloud scale and expertise, cloud vendors have now been able to lower their prices. [NOISE] Now, once you guys go out in the market, and to become Cloud engineers, you have to make into consideration as well that this is not your data center, and maintenance can happen without you knowing anything. Your instances will die. You have to use certain resources, and this is a problem. Now, your resources are not just used by you, but by many other entities. You're setting those resources. The architecture may change as well. You don't really own it. But even if you owned it, architecture evolves over time and over the years, and therefore changes are inevitable and of course, you never see the light. The common idea to have when you use the Cloud is that you must not trust it. You must assume that any failure can happen in the Cloud, and failures will happen because it's not all your own resource, but failures happen also in data centers. It's the way Cloud engineer have to think. They have to think that failures will happen, instances will die, availability zones or less a dataset may go down at any point of time, and therefore, they have to create systems that will be able to scale and as well as handle situations with failures.
