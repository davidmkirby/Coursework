 >> Welcome back, let's discuss today about the common Cloud vendors. Amazon Web Services is the most popular web Cloud vendor out there. AWS Web Services was actually one of the first, they offer different types of services for compute, to store adds to a database, to networking, migration tools, developer tools, management tools, security and compliance, analytics, Internet of things, mobile services, application services, and even machine learning, they do offer. Their services are fairly mature, which means that they are other level where it's being used in production by numerous companies, and there are also numerous companies that run the whole ecosystem on Amazon Web Services. Definitely the most mature Cloud vendor out there and one that has mostly the largest portion of the Cloud. If we see the AWS named as a leader, AWS has been named a leader in the infrastructure service magic quadrant. You can see now the leader in visionaries, Amazon Web Services, he is the one that is better to execute, as you can see on the left side, as well as it is more complete in terms of their vision, it is better situated than what Microsoft is. Google also comes third with being one of the leaders also, the three leaders in terms of the infrastructural service. Three smaller infrastructure services are even smaller than that, like Alibaba, Oracle and IBM are still trying to find a competitive advantage in their market share, but to be honest, all these other three have started way earlier on. It's really hard to get into that market. AWS officially launched in about 2006, we're talking about 12 years of experience. It started off by offering IT infrastructure services to businesses in the form of what we called Web Services. Amazon Web Services has data centers in US, Europe, Brazil, Singapore, Japan, Australia, and many other places as well. AWS provides highly available, scalable, low-cost infrastructure platform in the Cloud that powers hundreds of businesses in more than a 190 countries in the world. The beauty about AWS is that once you alliance with AWS, you can be able to be accessible in 190 countries in the world, which means that you can easily get from zero to a global business fairly fast. If we see the history of AWS, it started by Benjamin Black and Chris Pinkman, where they presented these paper that they envisioned Amazon retail computing, being automated, standardized, relying on web services. What we knew back then actually as Amazon selling books, that's when Black and Pinkman thought about having web services that they can support that retail business. In about 2004, the first service called Simple Queue Service started, it was launched, and then in 2007, Amazon had about 180,000 developers on the platform. 2010, all of Amazon.com Services moved to the Cloud effectively. They became one of the first Cloud native companies. 2011, there was a major outage on AWS because one of the elastic block storage volumes was stuck, and unable to take reads and writes. Since then, we're talking about seven years of progress. EBS has been fairly highly available, no single point of failures, still exist right now. In 2012, there was the first re-Invent conference. Re-Invent has evolved as a major conference about Cloud computing with more than 40-50,000 people attending the conference nowadays. It has been held every year in Las Vegas, in about end of November timeframe. 2020 AWS and Amazon promises that all the Cloud would actually run on renewable energy. Another big Cloud vendor, as we discussed before, is Google Cloud. Google Cloud is growing really fast. They have the App Engine, Compute Engine, Container Engine under the compute, they have Data Storage, Bigtable Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL and Cloud Datastore, on big data, they do have a number of products enormously later gum arabic products. If we try to compare and contrast these two services, I would say that Google Cloud services develop at a fairly more complete when they come out in the market compared to what you see on Amazon, but on the other hand, Amazon has the most services out there compared to any other vendor. Just a very short history about Google Cloud, 2008, about two to four years later than Amazon, the Google App Engine announced it's preview. It didn't come to production until about two years later to three years later, she was talking about a gap of a few years between Amazon and Google, Google Cloud Storage as large as 2010 and 2012, the computer engine is lapsed, AWS launched 2006 affecting the computer engines, talking about five to six years of experience that Amazon has built in a highly growth area. Definitely Google has a lot to cover, but I think they're growing really fast and really serious in this game. Another big player, maybe the second biggest player is Microsoft Azure. They do also have a number of services like compute, web, mobile developer services, integration, analytics and data, and then all the services they offer to the client in the same way as any other Cloud vendor does. Definitely mature service as well. They started about 2008, they announced the Windows Azure platform in 2010, it became commercially available, we see similarities with Google and Microsoft in terms of the timeline. 2014, there was a major outage that effectively broke MSN.com, since then things have improved, highly available services Cloud vendor has to be highly available because single-point of edges cannot exist in the Cloud computing domain. Overall great Cloud vendor. Now, the way we think the future, we don't know what will happen in the future, but what we do know is that right now, Amazon definitely has a competitive advantage over any other Cloud vendor. In the future, we'll have to see about how these things evolved over time, but then we see some good execution both from Google and Microsoft, and we'll see how that goes. What I believe is the future of Cloud computing is, the infrastructure as a service has been already commoditized, that means that having a virtual machine or a container to run your systems is easier to do it on the Cloud than on your own laptop nowadays and cheaper probably. We will see now the platform becoming commoditized for example, I want to store my data. I don't need to run my own database. I can really host everything on the Cloud.
