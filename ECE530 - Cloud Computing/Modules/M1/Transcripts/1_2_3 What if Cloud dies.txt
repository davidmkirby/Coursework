 >> Let us now discuss about what happens if the Cloud dies. Like, what if people are using Cloud and all of a sudden, the vendor that is offering the services decides not to offer services anymore, which means that, that may affect other commodities as well. The first thing that you have to consider is that the Cloud probably has better availability than you could do on your own. However, we have to consider retaining as much as in-house capacity as you need to stay alive and muddle through. That means that you need to have each extra capacity deserved from the Cloud to be able to accommodate cases where you don't have high availability. Let's see an example, a hospital or police department, which gets electricity from grid for normal operations, but they do keep backup generator for vital functions in case of an outage. That means that you still may have some local deployments that you can run in the Cloud. However, to be honest, most big vendors that are Cloud-native, don't even have this extra capacity. Also, we must be careful to maintain ability to access Cloud such as local routers. Which means that it's not only about the Cloud being available, but the access to the Cloud by the local network has to be made as well, which means that our local routers and infrastructure to connect to the internet and the Cloud has to be there. Let's discuss now about ultra-sensitive data. Some core, vital data you just can't trust to anyone else, for example, a Fidelity account contents or US Department of Defense submarine locations. You can't use an external cloud, but you may consider deploying an internal cloud with specific safeguards. This is, for example, how most of the most important US Department of Defense accounts work right now. Of course, you don't want to upload your vital data to the cloud, especially to public cloud infrastructure, but you may consider having some of this data in a private cloud infrastructure. These companies, like the Cloud vendors, often have much larger stores of data with low-security requirements for which cloud could be highly appropriate. Let's see an example, Fidelity fund prospects, and reports, US Department of Defense purchases of coffee and underwear. This, you can hide in a public cloud vendor bearing in mind that those cloud vendors offer very high security, probably, high security than what you see in most commercial environments. Let's now see some legal aspects. Sometimes law requires that certain data to be stored in specific countries or location, for example, EU has the specific laws. Sometimes you want data stored in a specific location to be accessible only by specific jurisdictions, for example, you don't want your self-care data to be accessed, the United States healthcare data to be accessed by a company, let's say in Panama. Technology changing faster than law can keep up. This is a big problem because the law usually is reactive and not proactive. More than a little bit tricky, Cloud could hurt, hosting not available in required jurisdiction, or help, quick switch of hosting into newly required jurisdiction. The stance of the law happens usually easily as we said reactively. Now let's go and discuss the availability of cloud resources. How sure are you that your cloud provider will have enough cloud resources available when you want to scale up, let's say particularly in burst situations? For example, if there is a hurricane and you have a lot of users accessing weather.com. How do you accommodate the fact that the cloud vendor will have these sources? The other question is, how badly will it hurt your business if you want to scale up, but you cannot? Scaling up is not always an issue of the cloud provider, but also on how fast you can do that, and how many resources you have in the background to be able to do that. Another question is, what remedies are available from a cloud provider if you cannot scale at the time you want to the degree that you want? These are usually described in an agreement that you have made with the cloud provider, which is called a service level agreement. Amazon has an interesting idea of spot market for computational resources. That means that you do have a reserved resources, there is a spot market, and there is also a general market, and into each of these markets comes with a separate price for using the services. This is the end of the Section 133.
