 >> We're moving to the next section of the advantages of cloud computing. The advantages of cloud computing is the lower computing cost. You do not now need to have a high-powered and high-priced computer to run your cloud computing's web-based applications. Since applications run in the cloud not on the desktop PC, your desktop PC does not need the processing power or hard disk space demanded by traditional desktop software. Therefore, it reduces the cost to maintain a fairly advanced desktop PC. When you are using web-based applications, your PC can be less expensive with a smaller hard disk, less memory, more efficient processor. In fact, your PC in the modern world does not even need a CD or a DVD drive as no software needs to be loaded or no documents needs to be saved. You also get improved performance, because now you have fewer and larger programs hogging your computer's memory. You will see the performance for your computer to improve and therefore you can have other applications that are more like CPU intensive compared to using those applications that you get, compared to a really running all applications in your PC. Computers in a cloud computing system boot and run faster because they have fewer programs and process load in the memory. Reduced software costs. Instead of purchasing expensive software applications, you can get most of what you need for free. For example, you can get Google Docs for free. Google Docs actually, it is a Software as a Service. You could get a lot of applications of the cloud as well for free, or for very low cost. Better than paying for similar commercial software which alone can be justification for switching to cloud applications, so that Google Docs with slides and documents, and Excels, you don't really need to have all these whole Microsoft suite in your laptop if you can run it on the cloud. In a similar way, backups of Docs has Microsoft online, in which it does have a lot of these desktop applications online as well. Instant software updates. Another advantage to cloud computing is that you are no longer faced with choosing between obsolete software and high upgrades costs. When the application is web-based, updates happen automatically, available the next time you log into the computer. When you access a web based application, you always get the latest version and if you don't, then you can refresh and really get the upgraded version. You don't need to pay or download an upgrade, you don't need really to have a high-performance, let's say network gig link to do that and so forth. So you definitely lower the cost and you are going towards more about thin client. So thin client means that you don't need to have big machines in your system in your home. For that, you need a thin client and all the sources are available in the cloud. This is exactly why you see now, like Pixelbooks offered by Google, like laptops, and exactly what you do, you have a Google documents, e-mails, and so forth, and even if you did, let's say to write some software, sometimes we do have web UIs where you can do that. So improved document format compatibility, that you don't have to worry about the documents you create on your machine whether it's compatible with another application operating system, because now everybody runs the same version of the cloud, they are adjusted to that. There are potentially no format incompatibilities when everybody is sharing documents and applications in the cloud, and you can also collaborate on the cloud as well with this, it is Software as a Service. You have unlimited storage capacity. Cloud computing offers limitless storage. Of course, you have to pay for that but definitely the cost is way lower. Your computer's current one terabyte hard drive is small compared to hundreds of petabytes available in the cloud. For example, many of us store our photos in iCloud if you use an iPhone, and many of us store our photos in Google Photos if you use on Android devices. Like Google Photos, the storage itself is totally for free. So this is a Software as a Service offered by Google, which you don't have to pay at all compared to storing in all your devices in hard drives and then having to have multiple backups and so forth. You also have increased data reliability, because unlike your desktop computing the cloud provider itself has all the backups and redundancy needed to maintain your data. So if a hard drive goes down or they have redundancy to make sure that you don't lose your data because you are accustomed to that. In a world where few individuals desktop PC users backup their data on a regular basis, cloud computing has become a more like a data safe computing platform. Universal document access. This is not a problem with cloud computing because you do not take your documents with you. Instead, they stay in the cloud and you can access them whenever you have a computer or an Internet connection. Documents are instantly available wherever you are, so you don't really need to copy or carry flash drive, or have to carry a DVD as we used to do in the old days, your data are located wherever you are as long as you have an Internet connection. Of course, you always get the latest version when you edit that you have document and you try to access it from another place. You don't really need to save and re-do it, your data are there whenever you open the platform. It's also easier to collaborate. Now, you don't really need to say, "I'm going to have this document that accompany your computer [inaudible] and give it back to me or email it to you." Now we can have this online platform where we can all go together, it has collaboration. It's totally collaborative document, you can have collaborate on slides, you can collaborate on Excel sheets, you can collaborate on coding, you can do a lot of different things, many users do this. It's definitely part of a Software as a Service platform. It is also is device-dependent. It doesn't matter if you use Linux, Mac, or Windows. If the system and the service is run on the cloud, then your cloud is just a gateway towards accessing the data. So you don't need to have an operating system, you don't need to upgrade it. Your computer doesn't really have to happen in the cloud. So in the old days, we had to update software operating system, we had to do security patches, and so forth. All these are now taken care by the cloud itself.
