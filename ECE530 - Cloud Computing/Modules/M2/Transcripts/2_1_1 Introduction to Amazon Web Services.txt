 >> Hello. Welcome to the second section for the ECE 530 Cloud Computing for the introduction to Amazon Web Services. Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand Cloud computing platforms and APIs to individual companies and governments on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. We have already discussed about how the Cloud works with a pay-as-you-go model, and this is how AWS also works. AWS is effectively just one of these many Cloud providers. Initially, it was launched in the July of 2002, mainly looking at the Amazon platform where people go and buy different types of products. They had spare resources that they didn't know how to use them, so they thought that we can use those spare resources of compute to give them to other users so they can use them on a pay-as-you-go model. In 2018, the AWS revenue was captured about 28.2 billion. As of today, the AWS is one of the major profits for the Amazon parent company. I think it's probably one of the highest growth subsidiaries that Amazon has. AWS technology is built on top of server farms, they call it datacenters that are deployed around the world. As of 2002, AWS comprised of 212 different types of services that they can deliver from compute storage, machine learning, and different types of services. Fees are based on a combination of usage like pay-as-you-go model as well as standard expenses. As of 2012, AWS is currently the dominant Cloud provider, capturing about 34 percent of the market. Obviously, currently with other providers like Google or Microsoft, the specialists may have shifted a bit, but still AWS remains the dominant Cloud provider by far, maybe three times larger than anybody else. AWS is a collection of remote computing services that together make up a Cloud computing platform. The three major elements, or high users elements of AWS is the compute. The service is called Elastic Compute and effectively this is virtual private servers. Somebody speeds up one of the servers and they use it as they would use their laptop, as they would use any remote machine that they want access to. So you get a system with a Linux operating system or a Windows operating system that you could use as you use your laptop. It's a virtual machine. Other compute platforms is the Elastic MapReduce, EMR, which is mainly a Hadoop framework running on EC2 instances. They provide different types of storage services. One of them is the S3, which is a Simple Storage Service. Simple Storage Service now has integrated with Glacier and other offerings where Glacier is the low-cost and long-term storage. Now, they have deep archive and have different types of storage tiers, as they call them, where you can effectively store your data with lower prices in terms of actually storing the data but with high prices when you actually retrieve the data in the low tiers. The basic tier S3, usually the access. It's a little more expensive to store the data, but retrieval rate is lower in terms of expenses. Different type of further services that they have is the Elastic Block Storage, which is effectively a persistent block level storage. So you see the difference, S3 is an object storage at Glacier and EBS is a block storage. It's a different type of offering based on the requirements. EBS is those storage devices that you attach to your EC2 instances that you can use to store extra spaces, just the local hard drives. Other offerings include databases where you can store structured data. The major one is DynamoDB which is the most famous one, which is a NoSQL backed by Solid State Drives. They have different other offerings like ElasticCache, which is an in-memory based Memcached, which is a software that effectively people use to cache data so that they don't overload the databases. It also have different type of databases for relational workloads like the called RDS, Relational Database Service. They have different types of variations, MySQL, Postgres, and so forth. These are similar to what you would get like Oracle or SQL server and so forth. So the AWS platform effectively is comprised of the Deployment & Administration layer, the Application Services, then they use Compute, Storage, Database, and even other different types of services right now. Then below that, AWS has the Networking where it's connecting all these virtual machines and all these EC2 instances together. Then effectively under that, they have the AWS Global Infrastructure, which is a global deployed data service infrastructure throughout the infrastructure. That's basically the introduction to AWS. In the next part, we're going to discuss more detail about the infrastructure itself.
