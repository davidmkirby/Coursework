 >> So let's talk about the AWS infrastructure. This is the Section 2 of the course. So AWS global infrastructure is comprised about multiple regions. They have effectively data centers around the world, from United States, Europe, Asia, South America. There's about 11 regions right now deployed. [NOISE] So those locations, they are allocated in different geographic regions, mainly the reasons we do that for disaster recovery. For example, if you have a hurricane that may hit one of the regions, then the other regions may be available to reroute the traffic. So effectively, each region has also, within that, isolated locations known as availability zones. For example, if we discuss about the US East, which is Northern Virginia, then you'll find out that there is effectively three data centers that are connect with each other, and they're separated by specific miles between each other. So even a region itself has three separate data centers. So that means that if the whole Northern Virginia goes down, you still have other regions. But if part of Northern Virginia goes down, we still have the other availability zones. So each region has two or more availability zones which are distinct data centers providing AWS services. I think the one region that has two availability zones is in US West 1, that is in Southwest. The major reason because it has two availability zones is because of very high real estate cost. So its Amazon EC2 region is designed to be completely isolated from the other Amazon EC2 regions. As we said this because of fault tolerance and stability. If one region goes down, if one goes down and you still are able to operate your service on the Cloud. As we see, as we deploy distributed systems on the Cloud, we'll identify that mainly this is the beauty of the Cloud, that somebody has taken care of the fail over, and the tolerance and the stability of it, and therefore, we only just need to develop an application on the Cloud that can scale by itself, at the same time be able to be available at all times with minimal cost. If you start to compare that, for example, if you have your own laptop or your own server at home, you can see that AWS or even any other Cloud provider provides substantially more stability and durability in cases of failures. So several services operate across availability zones. For example, includes like the storage service or database service, while others can be configured to replicate across zones. This is to spread demand and avoid downtime from failures. [NOISE] So let's go and see now how will you access website, how you can definitely go to different areas. So when you access a website, you make a web request and that goes to an Amazon Cloud front, that typically decides which location you are going to use. Right now, actually, this is probably outdated data, Amazon has at least 52 Edge locations. These are effectively Edge points and these are close to regions. So effectively, your request goes to one of these Edge points and then it's routed to the proper region to serve it. It used to cache data closed to the user, so latency are also reduced. So if you want to access through website a specific service, you can also cache a lot of the data within the Edge location as well. So effectively, they can be really, really fast. If we look at the AWS global infrastructure, we can see that there are different types of regions that each, as I say, that have two availability zones. One of them is Northern California. There are regions that are specifically designed for government, and then there are different types of regions around the world. Some of them that we see is actually coming soon had all the game. For example, India AP South 1 is already there right now. So if we see the AWS global map, we will see that it's divided in different areas. So when you say like US East 1, that covers United States East. There's US West Oregon, there's US West California, US West 2, and US West 1. There's South America, there's EU West 1 that is EMEA, and in Asia, Tokyo, Singapore, India, Sydney. This is how effectively AWS divides the areas that it sells through different traffics.
