 >> Let us now discuss the AWS networking. How is the networking services, and how's the networking being done in the background for the Amazon Web Services? So the number one service that is important to understand is the domain name system, so it's highly effectively unable to access website that is being hosted on AWS. The service is called Route 53, which is a highly available and scalable Cloud domain name system, DNS web service. Let's see an example. Assuming that the user wants to ask, "Okay, what is the website name that I want to see?" What you want to do is you want to resolve this name to a specific IP address. So what happens is the DNS resolver asks the AWS service called Route 53, which is the authority to give them the IP address that represents to that specific website. So Route 53 responds back to the DNS resolver, that the IP address for the specific abc.com is 192.0.3.2, and the DNS resolver gives this back to the user. So effectively this is how DNS works, you request for a specific website like www.facebook.com or amazon.com, and effectively you get to be routed to a DNS server. In this case AWS service have their own DNS server, which they call it Route 53. The second example is the virtual local area network, VLANs. AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS, they use what they call virtual local area networks. This is based on the IEEE protocol 802.1Q, which effectively says there's dedicated connection which can be partitioned into multiple visual interfaces. So therefore the data that you send over to AWS from your house, then it's actually encrypted and it is in your own network, so normally it calculates that bit and look at the data. Client can use the same connection to access public resources such as objects stored in AWS S3 using a public IP address space, and private resources such as EC2 instances running within the VPC using a private IP space, whilst still maintaining network separation between the public and the private environments. This is a great thing about AWS, is that you can actually split between what's publicly accessible versus what is privately accessible. Another thing that AWS provides is the AWS Direct Connect service, this is a service where effectively you have a direct connection to AWS, so you can have a very high throughput network connection. For example, here you may have a corporate data center, where you have your own system storage, movies or people at work, and then you use the Direct AWS Connect, which gives you about 10 gigabits per second and a 100 gigabits per second to AWS, which means that network to AWS is super, super really high, that's another service that AWS provides. Of course your network has to support that, but if it does support that then AWS make sure that your data are being rerouted to AWS really fast to access the services, so effectively get very high throughput and low latency by doing that. But the most important is to figure out is from your premises to the closest POP that AWS provides, point of presence means POP, with Direct Connect is to have high throughput. A virtual private Cloud is another offering by AWS, which lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud, where you can launch resources in a virtual network that you define. This allows you to totally separate your network with any other network, and therefore nobody can access, this is locked effectively. For example, you can create a public-interfacing subnet for your webservers, so you can have a public-facing app to Internet. But then your back-end services like database and application servers are only going to be faced by private-facing. So effectively, if you have somebody who's trying to access those, they could not be able to access, because they only get to access the public-facing. Let's give an example of a store that is hosted online, effectively you can access your own store to buy some clothes let's say, but the databases in the back-end systems that support the store are not accessible outside. It's important to maintain the security of your infrastructure as a customer of AWS, so AWS provides visibility to isolate your back-end systems and your front-end system.
