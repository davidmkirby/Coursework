 >> So let's talk about AWS, EC2, and EBS service, Elastic Compute and Elastic Block Storage. So Amazon Elastic Compute is a simple web service interface that allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. EC2 allows to provision virtual instances. Think about EC2 as the way that you would provision a virtual machine to do some work. So instead of using your own laptop, you're actually using now virtual machine that is based on a hypervisor learning on the system. The hypervisor that AWS is using is Xen Virtualization. EC2 now allows you to provision different types of operating systems from CentOS to Ubuntu to the Amazon's or Linux environment as well as the different varieties of Windows. Also for some companies where they want to provide their own operating systems or pre-configured instances, you can do that through the Amazon marketplace. So EC2 is effectively a compute service that effectively allows you to run your own virtual machines within AWS. So in EC2 you have effectively the route 53, which we discussed in the previous session, and then you have elastic load balancing. So when a request comes in that will be used by one of the, let's say web services deployed on EC2, then with AWS you can enable an auto scaling policy. That means that every auto scaling group that you have defined, can scale independently up and down and then you can have an ELB, an elastic load balance, that will distribute the load across those EC2 instances. So Auto Scaling. Auto scaling is effectively automatically sizing of compute clusters based on demand. You can define the minimum and the maximum number of instances in a specific group. Based on the data and based on the traffic, you can actually scale it up and scale it down. This can happen automatically by the Cloud service itself without the user doing any manual work. So as you can see here, we have an auto scaling group, and then you present it using this in CloudWatch. What CloudWatch is more like the monitoring metric system that AWS uses. Then based on specific metrics that you have defined, for example, increased or what is the throughput goes above 10 megabits per second, then effectively that causes up the scaling group to auto scale itself. So let's see now elastic load balancing. In this case, we have the DNS around everything. The user then goes to elastic load balancing, you have the auto scaling group that scales up and down the web services. So think about now you're accessing amazon.com on a day when everybody tries to access amazon.com, that for the service needs to scale up automatically. In the background what you do have is you probably have a database. You have, for example, the database of all the Amazon support the products that are related to amazon.com. Or if you're trying to access another vendor, it could be Facebook or the Facebook does really use AWS, then you will have the images that are of the faces of the people that are posting the images on the data store or even the metadata, and then you have the people auto scaling individual versus any other scaling group. Then of course, going back to the Facebook example, you will have the, for example, the customer data, the data store, but then you will have some of the images or some of the video files in the media files repository that will be set by the Cloud delivered network. So when we see these, think about these big [inaudible] this is being the media played. Same with Netflix as well. Netflix, you have the web services that access netflix.com. Once you get to stream a movie, the movie is actually being streamed by the media files repository to act specific on the delivery network. Amazon EBS is another service. It actually a block storage service. It's a service where you are mounting a specific block device to the instance so you can work on it. So for example, you can have an instance that has no hard drive, and AWS has a bunch of those. They have instances that don't even have a hard drive. So what you do is you can effectively atag or attach a block storage system that you can use to store your data, and it will appear as adorable back to point to the instance, no difference. So EBS provides a raw block device that can be attached with these two instances. EBS supports a number of advanced storage features including snapshotting and cloning. Now, the beautiful about the EBS is for example, if one of the volume goes down or if something happens to one of the volume, it actually does copy of the data, which is really great. Or you could even take snapshots of the data to another EBS volume or even to S3. So those are the things that allows you to effectively have high durability in the data in the amount points that you have on a specific EC2 instance. So let's see here an example. If you have Internet, you have access to your domain.com, it goes to elastic load balancer, you distribute the load across different types of instances. In this case, we have an emerge with I2.4xlarge. This is just an instance type out of the so many that AWS provides. Each of these instances now it's attached by a specific EBS storage. AWS may at some point provide a multi attached storage where we have multiple EBS instances that's the same instance, but for now, it provides the ability to have attach a specific EBS storage to a specific instance and all you add. Then you have an auto scaling group, which is effectively all the instances. As we said, as the load increases effectively what happens is, you vertically scale this AWS fixes. Now it's the 40, we have 10 to 80 or a 100. So another example is you go to netflix.com during the night hours when everybody is watching a movie, all over sudden, those web servers scale up to sustain to thousands to sustain the actual capacity that is being automatically calculated by the load balancer. In the morning when nobody is watching movies, then it scales down. Same with amazon.com and all the other services that follow the older pattern.
