 >> Now, after we discussed AWS services, Amazon Web Services, let's now look at another Cloud provider. In the end of a lot of these Cloud providers, I'm going to talk about some of the things that are common across different Cloud providers. So another Cloud provider is Google Cloud Platform. Google Cloud Platform, GCP otherwise is offered by Google. It's basically a suite of Cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its own end products where this is like Google Search or G-mail and YouTube. You can see the same kind of generation of how these cloud platforms are being started. Amazon started the Cloud platform because of the spare capacity during off-peak hours. Google starts its own Cloud oftenly because it has such a great infrastructure and the background, for having very fast search and then supporting great infrastructure for offering e-mail services or even like YouTube services. So when you think about, for example, using Google storage, you can think about the same storage that Google Cloud uses, is the same one that they store their own assets as they're getting published on YouTube. Then, Google Platform provides the same infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and serverless computing environments. We're going to discuss later on about serverless, and what does it mean really to use serverless. So when we see about the Google Cloud geographical map, you can see there's a bunch of data centers deployed around the world. From the United States, to Europe, to Asia, to Australia, to South America, we don't see actually one in Africa, and you can see that there are still continuously building new data centers. One of the difference for example, is Google has a data center in Los Angeles, AWS does not have one right now. So however, we see a lot of similarities, they have one in North Virginia, one in Oregon and so forth. AWS has one in Island, Google partly has one in London. So anyway, both of light is that they are distributing and they're building data centers all over the globe in order for people that want to access local data set, thus they can do that with effectively low-latency. So when you go to Google Cloud Platform, you get to these kind of website, where you got to use different types of service that they offer. The service they offer can be a batch, they have six other service or so, maybe a little less than what AWS provides. So they have an App Engine, Pub/Sub system, a Transfer Appliance, a Cloud Transfer Service, a Big Query Transfer Service, Cloud Functions. This is how we just upstream data. They have different things that store data, whether this is structured data, a database or big data, like Bigtable, Cloud Storage for a lot of data. Cloud SQL, if you're thinking of using different types of setups, says to do SQL queries to the database, memory store. If you want to use classes, don't mind the quiz if you do a database and different things like BigQuery to do big data analytics, to actually the most favorite shrine, which is Cloud spanner. So for those of you who don't know what's Cloud spanner, it's a very interesting paper. Highly I suggest reading that, I think have both of that in both of them in the course. [BACKGROUND] Another different services for process and analyze many of the big data sites under explore and visualize. One of the things that actually Google has advantage is it provides great interactions in their faces by the Google ecosystem, like the G-mail ecosystem with Google Sheets or so forth and the cool Cloud. Some that actually don't see that much in AWS, because there is no equivalent of C-Suite in AWS. Another thing that actually Google is actually pretty cool, the Google Cloud has the some of the AI machine learning with types of flow big, a very big one right now. They have popularized that very well within the Cloud, that's what [inaudible]. [NOISE] So when we think about the market study, we have so many Cloud providers, it's hard to compare and contrast and figure out who is actually winning the market share you know, obviously right now, AWS is about 30, 30 plus percent of the market share. Google is actually having second or third behind the Microsoft, though maybe second in some cases. But the probability is that back to the services or some of these Cloud providers other than AWS, they don't really publish their own revenue streams. So Google Cloud generated 2.6 billion in revenue in 2019. It's about the growth of 53 percent per year. So if you think about it, that growth is huge in terms of how much money they make year after year in Google services. For 2019 as a whole, Google bought about $8.9 billion. It's not yet a trillion business itself, but it grows with a 53 percent of growth, you can see how fast it's going to grow, which is of course, less than what AWS generated in the fourth quarter. So, if you ask me, which [inaudible] obviously AWS has a substance.
