 >> So let's move now to the last Cloud provider, which is Microsoft Azure. So Microsoft Azure is formerly known as Windows Azure, is another Cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. This is similar to the stories that we have heard with AWS and Google. It provides a similar software service, platform service, and infrastructure service, and some most different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including Microsoft-specific wireless and third-party software systems, something that we've seen in other Cloud providers. They may support, in some of the offerings, Microsoft specific products, but the integration you have with the.NET framework that Microsoft has produced, it's much better within Azure than what it is with other Cloud providers. However, if you think about how many users are actually using.NET framework may not be that many. Azure was announced in October 2008. Started with codename "Project Red Dog", and it was released two years later, and renamed Microsoft Azure in 2014. So this is mostly about history. But the interesting part of this history is that we can see that the difference between Amazon and Microsoft is that Amazon started maybe six to eight years before Microsoft did, which actually sees and indicates the reason why they have larger market share. It probably AWS has a much more mature Cloud ecosystem that Microsoft has, but we're getting to a point where Microsoft is actually increasingly really fast. If we'd actually deploy them, you can see they have from government, the specific data centers as you can see, in Virginia, in Central, in Texas and so forth. Even non-governments as well, like generic ones where people can actually use. They actually follow a similar pattern geographically; in India, Southeast Asia, Australia, Japan, and Korea are similar as we've seen Cloud providers. In Europe as well, different areas within Europe. Azure is generally available about 54 regions around the globe. Microsoft has announced additional 12 regions. That is as of the dated October 2018. Those regions increase really fast, actually trying to give a data point it's really hard with this course as we move from semester to semester. But bottom line, as of October 2108, the data indicates we have about 54 regions. Azure geographically contains multiple regions whether it's North Europe, West Europe and so forth, where a location represents the city or area of the Azure regions. Each Azure region is paired with another region within the same geography which makes them a regional each pair. In this example, Amsterdam, Netherlands, which form a region. This is some of the specific to Microsoft. Not many other Cloud providers actually follow that. So this is really interesting. So we see that the types of Azure Clouds similar to software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service, but the interesting part is that Microsoft offers integration with .NETServices, LiveServices, SharePoint Services, and even Microsoft CRM Services. The other beautiful thing is that similar to what Google does with the Google platform in the often, it gets with Microsoft Live and big and HealthVault and Microsoft Advertising and so forth. So if we see some of the symbols they use, they use symbols left and right, but the reason I put this slide is because similar technology in terms of availability zones, availability sets, single VM, region pairs, of course, it's specific to Microsoft not to others, but the rest of the terminology seems to be some standardizing across different Cloud providers. So one of the differences between Cloud providers and Azure uses its own fabric, its own layer that an operating system, which is called Microsoft Azure. It's the fabric layer. It's a cluster hosted of Microsoft data centers that effectively manages computer storage resource of the computers that produces the resources to applications running on top of Azure. This is different from what we've seen. For example, with AWS, Xen Hypervisor, more like an open standard one. Microsoft has its own type of provisioning the resources. Microsoft Azure has been described as a Cloud layer on top of a number of Windows Server systems such as Windows Server 2008. A customized version of Hyper-V, known as the Microsoft Azure Hypervisor to provide visualization of services. Again, you see different hypervisors. Again, AWS maybe using a different type. Actually, they use their own operating system to run their own services. Scaling and reliability are controlled by the Microsoft Azure Fabric Controller, which ensures the services and environment do not fail if one or more of the servers fails within the Microsoft data center. We've seen that in many Cloud providers, and which also provides the management of the user's Web applications such as memory and allocation and load balancing. Azure provides APIs, where we call it like REST APIs, HTTP ones, or even using XML ones. Microsoft provides a client-side managed class library that encapsulates the functions of interacting with the services. Again, this is common to all Cloud providers. They all provide libraries of how you can access the services. For example, if you go to access, the object store, they give you an object store as client that you can use inside the service itself to store large volumes of data. Now let's go to the benefits. One of the core strengths of Microsoft Azure is the ease of transition for organizations looking to migrate from different types of products like SharePoints to the Windows deployment. The task of administering certain technologies such as server Active Directory SharePoint can be really eased with combination of Azure and Office 365. Now the benefit of that is that it frees up IT staff to work on new projects rather than spending time on general system upkeep. So if you already are in the Microsoft ecosystem, moving to Azure it's easy. We see this idea of trying to integrate with some of the on-set hardware-based systems. With the CloudWatch, they make it easy to transition the customers from one to the other. Let's do a very simple overall comparison. Amazon Web Services, like Amazon itself, aims to be everything to everyone. As such, AWS has the most extensive portfolio of Cloud services of any other Cloud provider. I said, one of the reasons is because they started early and much earlier than other Cloud providers. Google Cloud Platform's core strengths are in machine learning, big data tools, and extensive container support. A lot of that is because Google has had great experience. It actually was the first to [inaudible] a lot of the texts of all machine learning tools. So it makes sense for them to be ahead compared to others. At the same time, if you think about analyzing data, Google was bats ahead of collecting all this data than anybody else and become a data company. So that's why they have these extensive tools. So let us see like garden, this is an interesting report, how do we see the growth of the market? So this is billions of dollars. So if you think about this year big amount, $266 billion, we expected a few years to be 354 billions of dollars. So Cloud is definitely growing a lot. It has been growing a lot for many years. So if you actually see and you compare from 2018 to 2022, we see a doubling of the amount of dollars that will be generated in different areas of the Cloud. A batch of that is now this of the software services, not infrastructure which are commoditized, but actually all the software, when people developing software that runs on the cloud itself. So how big is really Azure? I mean, this is the big question that everybody ask. How big is the Cloud provider? There is still no publicly available data on Azure sales. Azure is the part of Microsoft's Cloud business that most rhymes with AWS, but it is buried inside the commercial Cloud. A commercial Cloud is a roll up of multiple services from Microsoft. So everybody is not likely to buy a buffet that includes Azure, but it is not focused on that. So Microsoft commercial Cloud is about 50 billion annual rate. So how do you compare that with other Clouds? It's hard. So while Amazon specifies AWS revenue, I think same to Google, it marks all reports as Azure's growth rate. So the number is 62 percent, which is a lot. If you compare that, like for example, 2018, it was about 76 percent last year, so it's quite a lot and pretty fast compared to what AWS grows, but as I said, AWS is much older and much more mature.
